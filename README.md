This is just a play around experiment. Nothing serious.

# About
This is just a **very** simple way to implement a front end application, I'm simply doing this for fun above all else, this code serves no real purpose. 

At this moment in time the project is very 'raw' so to speak, so there's _very_ little code at the moment, code of which has not yet been tested or developed much further.

# Plans
I do look to include a .htaccess file just to demonstrate how someone may be able to run this code on an apache server, of course with GitHub, you can't execute .htaccess, you have to use config.yml, which essentially can behave _very_ similar if not the same. 

I also plan to make a nice searching & sorting feature within this application, just to demonstrate how powerful JavaScript really is and how you can execute queries in the front end without having to execute any server side code/script's. These days you can _practically_ mimic serverside code on the front end. 

I also plan to use **very** little css, the css that will be used on this web app will be barebone, I mean just enough so that it doesn't look like an eye sore, that's about it.
